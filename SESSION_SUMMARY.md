# Session Summary - October 27, 2025

## What We Accomplished Today ✅

### 1. Fixed Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration
- **Problem**: Tailwind CSS styling wasn't loading - got PostCSS plugin errors
- **Root Cause**: Had conflicting packages (v3 + v4) and wrong setup approach
- **Solution**: Migrated to proper Tailwind v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin
- **Result**: Beautiful gradient login page now displaying correctly at http://107.173.91.179:5173

### 2. Technical Changes Made
- Removed: tailwindcss@3, @tailwindcss/postcss, postcss.config.js, tailwind.config.js
- Installed: tailwindcss@4, @tailwindcss/vite
- Updated: vite.config.js to include Tailwind Vite plugin
- Simplified: index.css to just `@import "tailwindcss";`

### 3. Current System Status
- ✅ Backend API running on port 3001
- ✅ Frontend running on port 5173
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 styling working perfectly
- ✅ All code committed to GitHub (7 commits total)
- ✅ Local backup synced to K:\AI-Projects\Proj

## Next Steps for Tomorrow 🚀

### Phase 5: Dashboard & Project Management UI
**Goal**: Build the project dashboard where users can see and manage their projects

#### Tasks to Complete:
1. **Project List Component**

3. **Project Card Actions**
   - Edit project button
   - Delete project (with confirmation)
   - Click to open Gantt view

4. **Search & Filter**
   - Search projects by name
   - Filter by assigned role
   - Sort by date created/modified

### Phase 6: SVAR Gantt Integration (After Dashboard)
- Install @svar-ui/react-gantt
- Create Gantt component
- Connect to task API
- Implement drag-and-drop
- Add color coding and dependencies

## Commands to Restart Servers

If servers go down, run these commands:

```bash
# Backend
ssh root@107.173.91.179 'cd /home/user/project-management/backend && nohup npm run dev > /var/log/backend.log 2>&1 &'

# Frontend
ssh root@107.173.91.179 'cd /home/user/project-management/frontend && nohup npm run dev > /var/log/vite-success.log 2>&1 &'
```

Check if running:
```bash
ssh root@107.173.91.179 'ps aux | grep node'
```

## Test Credentials

Test users created in previous sessions:
- Email: test@example.com / Password: password123
- Email: admin@example.com / Password: password123

Test projects:
- Project ID 1: "Website Redesign"
- Project ID 2: "Mobile App Development"

## Important Notes
- Always use IP address (107.173.91.179) not localhost
- Servers are running directly on VPS (not in Docker yet)
- Tailwind v4 requires NO config files - everything in vite.config.js
- All changes synced to GitHub: https://github.com/kedhead/proj
